# Count the number of times each character occurs in the given 'text' string.

# Only count characters and digits - don't include spaces, punctuation of other symbols.

# When counting the characters, ignore case.

# Store the count in the 'word_count' dictionay that has been declared for you, in the starter code.

# The key must be the character, and the value associated with the key should be the count of this particular character in the 'text'.

# Example: If the 'text' was "abcbcc", your 'word_count' dictionary will have 3 key value pairs: 'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3
