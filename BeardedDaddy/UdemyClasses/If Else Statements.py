# The if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and false part of a given condition. If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block is excuted.
#Examples: (equals: a == b) (Not Equals: a != b) (Less than: a < b) (Less than or equal to: a <= b) (Greater than: a > b) (Greater than or equal to: a >= b)
a = 5
b = 2
if a < b:
    print("A is less than B")
    print("A is definitely less than B")
else:
    print("A is Not is less than B")
print("This is a simple math bruh")
