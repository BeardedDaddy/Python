# Functions

Create a function named tripleprint  that takes a string as a parameter and prints that string 3 times in a row. So if I passed in the string hello  it would print hellohellohello

def tripleprint(string):
    print(string * 3)

tripleprint("hello")

*Be sure to only create the function, don't call it. For example, don't write tripleprint("hello")  The exercise will do this for you.
