# Create a generator that will return the complete filename of all mp3 files

The generator should start at a specified directory, the start, which will be provided as an argument to the generator function.

The filenames should include the full path from the specified start directory. So it'll return a relative path.

Make the generator function generic, so it can handle files with any extension. So pass the extension as a second parameter to the function.
