# My notes from checkdb

## the name at the end in parathesis has comma with it to make it a tuple

## If you do not use a comma you will get a ProgrammingError

## Incorrect number of bindings supplied. The current statement uses 1, and there are 5 supplied

## Also in that line you can use LIKE so that the query does not have to be case sensative
