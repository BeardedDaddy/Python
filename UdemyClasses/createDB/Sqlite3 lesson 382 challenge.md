# Udemy lesson 382 sqlite challenge.

Modify the checkdb program so that it asks the user to enter a nme, then use a WHERE clause in the SQL statement to retrieve just the row for that one person.
It seems simple, but if you find yourself struggling with the Python syntax, then go back and watch the tuple videos in Section 7.
Before you start, remember to change the table name in checkdb back to contacts because if you recall I changed that to sqlite_master in the previous video.
