# This is a sqlite challenge.

1. Create a new Python file, and write the code to print out all the records in the contacts.sqlite database.
2. Check the result, and explain why it's not what we'd expect.

3. Modify the checkdb program so that it asks the user to enter a name, then use a WHERE clause in the SQL statement to retrieve just the row for that one person.

4. Remember to change the table name back to contacts- I'd changed it to sqlite_master earlier.
